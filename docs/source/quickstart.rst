Quickstart Guide
=========================

**Installation**

The benchmarks do not need to be installed. Each benchmark is provided as a Dockerfile.

Requirements:

* Docker
* python


**Contributing**

We welcome any new benchmarks added to the collection. To add a new benchmark you will need a Dockerfile containing the code and a README.md.
Place these into a folder within benchmarks.

The README must follow the structure prescribed. A template README can be found in the docs folder.
Ensure that all appropriate sections are filled.

Some components of the README can be auto-generated by using the `generate_benchmark_readme_info.py` in the docs folder.

To include images in the readme either link to an external website or place the image into docs/source/images and provide the full path to the raw image.
