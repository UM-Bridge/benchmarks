## Description

![cookies-problem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UM-Bridge/benchmarks/main/models/cookies-problem/cookies_domain.png "geometry of the cookies problem")

The benchmark implements a forward uncertainty quantification problem for the [cookies model](https://github.com/UM-Bridge/benchmarks/tree/main/models/cookies-problem/README.md). More specifically, we assume that the uncertain parameters $$y_n$$ appearing in the definition of the diffusion coefficient are uniform i.i.d. random variables on the range $$[-0.99, -0.2]$$ and we aim at computing the expected value of the quantity of interest (i.e., output of the model) $$\Psi$$, which is defined as the integral of the solution over $$F$$.

The PDE is solved with an IGA solver that uses as basis splines of degree $$p=4$$ and maximal regularity, i.e. of continuity $$3$$, and the mesh has $$200 \times 200$$ elements (i.e., the fidelity config parameter is set to $$2$$). The structure of this benchmark is identical to the one discussed in \[1\]; however, raw numbers are different since in \[1\] the PDE solver employed was different (standard FEM with piecewise linear basis) and the mesh was also different.


As a reference value, we provide the approximation of the expected value computed with a standard Smolyak sparse grid, based on Clenshaw--Curtis points, for level $$w=5$$, see e.g. \[2\]. The resulting sparse grid has 15713 points, and the corresponding approximation of the expected value is $$0.064196096847169$$.


The script available [here](https://github.com/UM-Bridge/benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/cookies-problem/run_forward_benchmark_in_matlab.m) generates the results, using the Sparse Grids Matlab Kit \[2\] for generating sparse grids. The Grids Matlab Kit is available on Github [here](https://github.com/lorenzo-tamellini/sparse-grids-matlab-kit) and a dedicated website with full resources including user manual is available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-grids-kit).
