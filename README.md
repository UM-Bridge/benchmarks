UM-Bridge is an open source project that enables easy and fast coupling between UQ software and simulation software. It separates both sides by introducing a new standardized network interface.

This repository hosts stand-alone reference problems for benchmarking of UQ algorithms.

The documentation for the project and for the benchmark problems within is at: [Documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/)
